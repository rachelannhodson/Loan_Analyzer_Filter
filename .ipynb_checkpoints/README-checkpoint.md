# Loan Analyzer and Filter

This is a [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) application in which you can enter loan information and then use the given code to determine whether the present and anticipated future values of loans make them worth purchasing. At the end, you can print a new `.csv` file with the loans you believe are worth the price.
